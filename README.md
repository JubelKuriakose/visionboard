## Developing with Gitpod

This template repository also has a fully-automated dev setup for [Gitpod](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html).

The `.gitpod.yml` ensures that, when you open this repository in Gitpod, you'll get a cloud workspace with .NET Core pre-installed, and your project will automatically be built and start running.
